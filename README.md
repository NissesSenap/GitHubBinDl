# GitHubBinDl

I need a easy way to get the last binaries from a number of open-source projects
that I follow closely, for example tekton and helm.

I want a easy config file that makes this tool easy to run multiple times,
ether as a cronjob or a manual process.

I trust the community to not perform breaking changes overall and they only provide me with a binary.

Is this a over engineering of a simple script? Most definitely but I think it's fun
and I want a config file to manage what I download in a easy way.
